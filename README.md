## üß† Agentive AI Characteristics

This application embodies **agentive AI** through autonomous decision-making capabilities and goal-oriented behavior. The system uses the **Agno (v1.7.0)** framework to create an intelligent agent characterized by:

**ü§ñ Autonomous Analysis**: The agent independently analyzes stock valuations by automatically detecting sectors, fetching peer data, and calculating comparative metrics without human intervention for each step.

**üîß Tool Integration**: It leverages multiple specialized tools (**YFinance v0.2.63** for real-time data, **Ollama v0.5.1** for local AI reasoning) to gather information and generate insights, demonstrating the agent's ability to orchestrate complex workflows.

**üéØ Goal-Directed Behavior**: The agent operates with clear objectives - comparing stocks against sector peers, identifying valuation discrepancies, and providing investment analysis - executing these tasks systematically through structured prompts and instructions.

**üßÆ Adaptive Reasoning**: Using local **Ollama v0.5.1** models, the agent processes financial data contextually, generating detailed 800+ word analyses that explain valuation metrics and provide conclusions about whether stocks are overvalued or undervalued.

**üìä Proactive Information Gathering**: The agent doesn't just respond to queries but proactively identifies relevant sector ETFs, fetches constituent data using **YFinance v0.2.63**, and performs comprehensive peer comparisons with **Pandas v2.3.0** data processing to provide actionable investment insights through the **Streamlit v1.46.1** interface.
